    <string name="text_about_us">Step 1. Calculate net income,
    which is your take-home pay minus deductions
    for taxes and employer-provided programs.
    Focus on net income to avoid overspending.
    Keep detailed notes of contracts and pay for freelancers,
    gig workers, contractors, or self-employed individuals to manage irregular income.
    Step 2.Track your spending
    to determine where your money is going.
    Start by listing fixed expenses like rent,
    utilities, and car payments, followed by variable expenses like groceries,
    gas, and entertainment. Use credit card and bank statements to categorize
    your monthly expenditures and identify areas for savings.
    Step 3. Set realistic short- and long-term financial goals
    before tracking information. Short-term goals, like emergency
    fund or debt reduction, take one to three years to achieve,
    while long-term goals, like retirement savings or education,
    may take decades. Identifying these goals can motivate sticking
    to your budget, making it easier to cut spending.</string>
